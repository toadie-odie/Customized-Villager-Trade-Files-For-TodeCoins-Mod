The purpose of this repository is to share some default customized villager trade files for the TodeCoins mod to make use of the coins the mod provides.

I have added trades to these files for the following mods:
* Supplementaries - https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/supplementaries
* Farmer's Delight - https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/farmers-delight
* Biomes O' Plenty - https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/biomes-o-plenty
* Friends and Foes - https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/friends-and-foes-forge

You'll need to remove the trades from these files for the mods you're not using.

A wiki has been created to provide instructions if needed.

Feel free to let me know if there is anything you need.

If you'd like to use my currency conversion chart to aid you in customizing your trades, you can find it here:
