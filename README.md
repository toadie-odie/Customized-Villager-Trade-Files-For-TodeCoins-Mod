The purpose of this repository is to share some default customized villager trade files for the TodeCoins mod to make use of the coins the mod provides.

I have added trades to these files for the following mods:
* Supplementaries - https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/supplementaries
* Farmer's Delight - https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/farmers-delight
* Biomes O' Plenty - https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/biomes-o-plenty
* Friends and Foes - https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/friends-and-foes-forge

You'll need to remove the trades from these files for the mods you're not using.

A wiki has been created to provide instructions if needed.

Feel free to let me know if there is anything you need.
