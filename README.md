# Files-for-the-Custom-Villager-Trades-Mod
The Custom Villager Trades Mod allows you to customize villager trades with JSON files. These files are my personal customizations using that mod for my mods.

Specifically, these files are for customizing the villager trades for the TodeCoins mod I've made.

In order to use these files, you will need to download the Custom Villager Trades Mod from here:
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/custom-villager-trades-forge
and then place my custom files into the mod's config folder.
