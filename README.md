# Files for the Custom Villager Trades mod

The Custom Villager Trades Mod allows you to customize villager trades with JSON files. These files are my personal customizations using that mod for my mods.

Specifically, these files are for customizing the villager trades for the TodeCoins mod I've made.

In order to use these files with my TodeCoins mod, you will need to download the Custom Villager Trades Mod from here:

* https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/custom-villager-trades-forge

install the mod into your modpack and then place my custom files into the mod's config folder.
